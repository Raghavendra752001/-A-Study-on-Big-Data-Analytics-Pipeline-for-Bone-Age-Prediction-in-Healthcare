**ðŸ¦´ A Study on Big Data Analytics Pipeline for Bone Age Prediction in Healthcare**
This project explores the design and implementation of a Big Data analytics pipeline to predict bone age using medical imaging and deep learning. Leveraging technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and TensorFlow, the project demonstrates how scalable data processing and AI can improve diagnostic efficiency in the healthcare domain.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Bone age assessment is a crucial task in pediatric radiology, enabling doctors to determine a child's growth and developmental stage. Traditional methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to subjectivity. This study introduces an automated solution using a Big Data pipeline and machine learning to:

Process large-scale medical imaging data

Extract features and train deep learning models

Deliver accurate and fast bone age predictions

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Hadoop	Distributed data storage using HDFS
Spark	: Scalable data processing and transformations
Hive	Querying large datasets with SQL-like syntax
TensorFlow	Deep learning for model training and prediction
Python	is a Core language for scripting, modeling, and orchestration
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib	: Data handling and visualization

ðŸ”„ Pipeline Architecture
Data Ingestion
Medical images and metadata are loaded into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

Data Processing
Apache Spark is used for fast, in-memory transformations and preprocessing (resizing, normalization, etc.).

Feature Extraction
Hive is used to query structured data for insights and model readiness.

Model Training
TensorFlow-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on preprocessed images to predict bone age.

Evaluation & Visualization
Model accuracy and error rates are visualized using Python libraries.

âœ… Key Outcomes
Demonstrated a scalable, end-to-end Big Data pipeline for medical image analysis.

Achieved improved diagnostic support through accurate bone age prediction.

Highlighted the importance of reproducibility, flexibility, and data pipeline integrity in healthcare analytics.
